### **Getting Started with Neovim – The Modern Vim**

If you’ve spent any time in the command line, you’ve likely come across **Vim**, the text editor that’s been around since the 90s. Enter **Neovim**, a modernized version of Vim that brings significant improvements in functionality, usability, and extensibility. Released in 2014, Neovim has quickly gained popularity among developers and power users for its enhanced performance and modern features, all while retaining the powerful editing capabilities of Vim.

Whether you're a seasoned Vim user or new to text editors in the terminal, Neovim is worth exploring. In this post, we'll walk through the process of installing Neovim on a typical Linux system, setting it up to behave like Vim, and streamlining your workflow by creating aliases.

### **Why Use Neovim?**

Before diving into the installation process, let’s highlight a few reasons why Neovim has become the go-to editor for many users:

1. **Asynchronous Plugins**: One of the biggest improvements in Neovim is support for asynchronous plugins, which means plugins can run in the background without blocking the editor, making it faster and more efficient.
   
2. **Better Extensibility**: Neovim’s architecture makes it easier to write and manage plugins using modern languages like Lua, whereas Vim plugins are often written in Vimscript or Python.

3. **Improved UI and UX**: Neovim includes a more modern user interface with better support for colors, mouse control, and external tools, making it more flexible for customization.

4. **Streamlined Codebase**: Neovim has cleaned up a lot of legacy code from Vim, resulting in a more efficient, maintainable codebase.

### **Installing Neovim on Linux**

Now that you know why Neovim is so popular, let’s get it installed on your Linux system. Follow these steps for a simple installation.

#### **Step 1: Download the Tarball**

First, head over to the [Neovim GitHub page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#linux) for the latest installation instructions, or use the following to download the latest tarball:

```bash
wget https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/stable/nvim-linux64.tar.gz
```

This command will download the latest stable version of Neovim.

#### **Step 2: Untar the File**

Once the tarball is downloaded, you'll need to unpack it. Use the following command to untar the file:

```bash
tar -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz
```

This will extract the Neovim files into a folder called `nvim-linux64` in your current directory.

#### **Step 3: Add Neovim to Your PATH**

Next, you’ll want to make Neovim accessible globally from the command line. To do this, export the Neovim binary path to your `PATH` variable:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/nvim-linux64/bin
```

You can add this line to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh) to make it persistent:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/nvim-linux64/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

This way, Neovim will always be available whenever you open a new terminal session.

### **Aliasing Neovim to Vim**

Are you used to typing `vi` or `vim` and find it hard to break the habit? Don’t worry, you can alias `vi` and `vim` to Neovim so that you don’t have to remember to type `nvim` every time.

#### **Step 1: Edit Your .bashrc File**

Open your `.bashrc` file using Neovim itself (or any other editor):

```bash
nvim ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Step 2: Add the Alias**

Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` to alias `vi` and `vim` to `nvim`:

```bash
alias vi='nvim'
alias vim='nvim'
```

This means that from now on, whenever you type `vi` or `vim`, Neovim will be launched instead.

#### **Step 3: Reload Your .bashrc**

For the changes to take effect, reload your `.bashrc` file with the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you can use `vi` and `vim` commands, and Neovim will be launched, making your transition to Neovim completely seamless.

### **Neovim vs. Vim: What’s the Difference?**

You might be wondering, "What are the real differences between Vim and Neovim?" While Neovim retains the core editing capabilities of Vim, here are some key distinctions:

1. **Async Plugin Support**: As mentioned earlier, Neovim’s asynchronous job control means plugins don’t block the editor, leading to a smoother experience.
   
2. **Extensibility**: Neovim can be extended using Lua, making it easier to write modern, efficient plugins.

3. **Improved Defaults**: Neovim comes with better default settings out of the box, meaning less configuration is needed to get started.

4. **Embedded Terminal**: Neovim has an integrated terminal emulator, allowing you to run terminal commands inside the editor—something that Vim lacks natively.

5. **Community-Driven**: While Vim is maintained by a single developer (Bram Moolenaar), Neovim has a large and active community contributing to its development, leading to faster updates and feature additions.

### **Conclusion: Why Neovim?**

Neovim is more than just a Vim clone—it’s a powerful, modern editor built for the future of development. Whether you’re looking for better performance, modern plugin support, or a streamlined experience, Neovim offers all the benefits of Vim with significant upgrades.

For long-time Vim users, the transition to Neovim is nearly seamless, and tools like aliasing and the familiarity of commands make it easy to switch over. If you’ve never tried Neovim before, now’s the time to give it a shot!
